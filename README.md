## Overview
The purpose of this challenge is to build one app a day in next 30 days. I might not be able to build the apps daily but will endeavour to finish challenge as soon as possible. The main purpose is to learn and practice JavaScript.

### Chalenge 01
I had to build the music buttons to play the tune once a specific key on keyboard pressed.
What did I learn:
- Keydown event - i learn that this event can associate a key on keyboard with the number. This number can be linked to data-key in html
- Transitionend event - that can be used once CSS transition event finished.

### Chalenge 02

I had to build the analog clock. 
What did I learn:
- setInterval function

### Chalenge 03

Really enjoyed this challenge. It was good to repeat all basic JS functions. I am proud I parsed the webpage and built api for that. I did it in the vscode rather than in the browser.
I feel more comfortable with APIs.

### Chalenge 04

It was a good exercise to practice CSS animation and CSS Transition properties.

Working with arrays is fun and important to repeat the functions.
