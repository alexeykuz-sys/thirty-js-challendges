## Overview
The purpose of this challenge is to build one app a day in next 30 days. I might not be able to build the apps daily but will endeavour to finish challenge as soon as possible. The main purpose is to learn and practice JavaScript.

### Chalenge 01
I had to build the music buttons to play the tune once a specific key on keyboard pressed.
What did I learn:
- Keydown event - i learn that this event can associate a key on keyboard with the number. This number can be linked to data-key in html
- Transitionend event - that can be used once CSS transition event finished.
